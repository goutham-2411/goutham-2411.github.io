For a long time, welding has been a very important fabrication process which
requires great skill and personal risk from the welder.
With welding robots brought into industries, there is greater efficiency and
precision in the weld of the finished products without the prerequisites and
risks taken by the welder. With welding robots, products are finished much
faster and better. ðŸ’¡
