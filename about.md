Hello folks, I am **Goutham T S** a 3rd year student at Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal. I am pursuing my B.Tech in Electronics and Instrumentation. My areas of interests are mainly in Coding, Iot and mostly in aerospace. My aim is to pursue MS in a well renowed German University and then to get into a organisation that mainly focuses on Automation domain and related. I am also part of ISA, Manipal and Robotics and Circuits team at my college. We are working on cool projects.

This is all for now, I will be updating this page every now and then.

Thank you.
